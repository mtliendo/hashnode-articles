## The fullstack guide to creating AppSync APIs with the AWS CDK

# Overview

[AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) is a managed GraphQL service that helps in building scalable GraphQL APIs. 

I've written and talked at length about how you can easily create AppSync APIs by using [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/).

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2B8cp1EyE]

However, there are times when using Amplify to create your backend isn't the best requirement (that's ok!). 

A few reasons why this might be the case:

- Keeping the backend separate from the frontend
- Having complete control over how the data is sent and retrieved
- Making use of other types of AppSync resolvers (HTTP, NONE, etc)
- Integrating newly released features of AppSync/CDK as quickly as possible

For many applications, the above reasons aren't enough to leave the ease and simplicity that Amplify provides. However, this post will provide a sturdy entry point for those wanting to venture down this path and I'll try to call out some of the tradeoffs along the way.

This post will be made up of two applications:

**Backend**: We'll start here. This will leverage the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) to create our various services

**Frontend**: A *simple* application built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). We'll use the [Amplify libraries](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/query-data/q/platform/js/) to connection our frontend with our backend. 

> üö® This post assumes you have both [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), and a local AWS profile setup. It also assumes you have a basic understanding of AWS and its services.

# Initializing our backend

As is best practice, we'll use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to create a reusable backend. There are many ways to do this: [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), Amplify, etc. 

Though as mentioned, we'll use the CDK since many teams enjoy having a common language (TypeScript/JavaScript in this case) that they can work with across stacks.

To get started creating a new CDK app, run the following command in your terminal:

```js
mkdir appsync-todo-backend && cd $_ && npx aws-cdk init -l typescript
```
> üìù The above command creates a directory, changes into it, and initializes a new CDK project--using TypeScript as the language.

Once done, open up the project in your code editor (I'll be using VS Code).

# Service overview

In terms of the services we'll need, there are only a few:

**Amazon Cognito**: We'll need to create a UserPool, a UserPool group, and a UserPool Client for our API. This will allow users to authenticate with our application.

**AWS AppSync**: The core of our application. In addition to our schema, this will have our UserPool as the default authorization mode, but also generate a public API key as a secondary mode. In addition, we'll turn on some simple observability settings before constructing our resolvers.

**Amazon DynamoDB**: In this post, we'll only have a single table called **Todos**.  This table will serve as a datasource for our API.

# Setting up Cognito

Open up the `appsync-todo-backend-stack.ts` file and add in the following imports:

```js
import {
	AccountRecovery,
	CfnUserPoolGroup,
	UserPool,
	UserPoolClient,
	VerificationEmailStyle,
} from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito'
```
Then underneath the `super(scope, id, props)` call, paste in the following:

```js
const userPool = new UserPool(this, 'todoTestUserPool', {
  selfSignUpEnabled: true,
  accountRecovery: AccountRecovery.PHONE_AND_EMAIL,
  userVerification: {
    emailStyle: VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
  },
  autoVerify: {
    email: true,
  },
  standardAttributes: {
    email: {
      required: true,
      mutable: true,
    },
  },
})
```
Using the [L2 Cognito construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-construct-library.html) (APIs made for the CDK), we can create a UserPool that allows users to signup with their email and get send a confirmation code to verify their account. 
> üö® If coming from Amplify, note that this uses the the [default password policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-policies.html), and is stricter than what Amplify enforces by default. Feel free to [change accordingly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.CfnUserPool.PasswordPolicyProperty.html).

In our app, we will only give `Admin` users the ability to delete `Todo` items. To help codify  this, we'll create a Cognito User Group. However, the L2 construct we are using doesn't provide a way to create the group. Fortunately, we can drop down to the L1 CloudFormation construct and add it in a few lines of code:

```js
new CfnUserPoolGroup(this, 'TodoUserPoolGroup', {
  userPoolId: userPool.userPoolId,
  groupName: 'Admin',
  description: 'Admin users for the TodoTestAPI',
})
```

Leveraging the Userpool ID from the last section, we create the group and give it a description.

Lastly, because we'll be leveraging Cognito in the browser, we'll create a [web client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html):

```js
const userPoolClient = new UserPoolClient(this, 'UserPoolClient', {
  userPool,
})
```
üéâ Just like that, we are done setting up Cognito.

# Creating our Todo table

Creating a DynamoDB table is one of the simpler things to do. Start by importing the relevant library parts:

```js
import {
	CfnOutput,
	Duration,
	Expiration,
	RemovalPolicy,
	Stack,
	StackProps,
} from 'aws-cdk-lib'
import { AttributeType, BillingMode, Table } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb'
```

From here, we'll create our table just under where we created our UserPool Client:

```js
const todoTable = new Table(this, 'Todo Table', {
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
  billingMode: BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
  partitionKey: { name: 'id', type: AttributeType.STRING },
})
```

That's it! All of our `Todo` items will have a unique `id` field. Similar to Amplify, the database itself will be [On Demand](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/on-demand/). 

> üìù  Note that I'm also adding a `removalPolicy`. This is different from Amplify such that if I delete my CDK project, my database will be deleted also since I have a `DESTROY`    policy as opposed to `RETAIN`.

# Creating our API Schema

One of the main differences between Amplify and AppSync API development is that AppSync sits one level lower than Amplify. 

It still has a concept of directives, however they're less robust in favor of being less opinionated.

To get started creating our schema, create a new file in the `lib` directory called `schema.graphql`.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658762101944/-_hdz11cU.png align="left")

In this file, we'll create our root level types:

```ts
type Query {
	getTodo(id: ID!): Todo @aws_api_key @aws_cognito_user_pools
	listTodos: [Todo] @aws_api_key @aws_cognito_user_pools
}

type Mutation {
	addTodo(input: TodoInput): Todo @aws_cognito_user_pools
	updateTodo(input: TodoInput): Todo @aws_cognito_user_pools
	deleteTodo(id: ID!): Todo @aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: ["Admin"])
}

type Subscription {
	onAddTodo: Todo @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["addTodo"])
}
```

In the above code snippet, we see that we'll be creating the following actions:

- **getTodo**: Takes in an `id` and returns a single `Todo`.
- **listTodos**: Doesn't take in any arguments. Simply returns all of the `Todo` items.
- **addTodo**: Takes in an `input` object that contains all of the fields needed to create a `Todo`.
- **updatedTodo**: Same as adding a `Todo`, except will update field contents
- **deleteTodo**: Takes in an `id` and returns the `Todo` that it deleted.
- **onAddTodo**: A listener that will create a websocket connection to listen for whenever a `Todo` is created. 

By design, every AppSync API needs some level of authorization. There is no such thing as a public AppSync endpoint. At best, we can create a public API key--which we'll do in the next section.

However, it's possible to layer authorization rules as well.  The `getTodo` field is a great example of this. Note that we have the following:

```ts
getTodo(id: ID!): Todo @aws_api_key @aws_cognito_user_pools
```

The `@aws_api_key` tells AppSync that this field (rather, the `read` ability) can be accessed if the request is passed an API key.

Additionally, the  `@aws_cognito_user_pools` directive acts similarly to the 
`@auth(rules: {allow: private)` directive in Amplify by allowing access to logged in users.

> üìù Note that the `@aws_cognito_user_pools` directive can be expanded to only authorize particular Cognito groups (as shown on the `deleteTodo` field).

> üìù This is likely the biggest transition when leaving the guardrails of an Amplify project. Directives such at `@default` and concepts such as only allowing `owner` access are not defined in a pure AppSync application.

With our schema created, the last thing to do is to add the `Todo` type and it's corresponding input.

```ts
type Todo {
	__typename: String!
	id: ID
	createdAt: AWSDate!
	updatedAt: AWSDate!
	name: String!
	owner: String!
	description: String
}

input TodoInput {
	__typename: String!
	id: ID
	createdAt: AWSDate!
	updatedAt: AWSDate!
	name: String!
	owner: String!
	description: String
}
```
While not all of these fields are necessary, I'm choosing to add them so that in a later post, we can see how VTL can be used to set the for us.

# Creating our AppSync API

At the time of this writing, there are no official L2 constructs for AppSync. However, there is a package that is nearing release üòä 

We'll make use of this project by first installing it in our project:

```bash
npm install @aws-cdk/aws-appsync-alpha
```
> üìù For posterity, I'm using version **`2.33.0-alpha.0`**

Once installed, open up your CDK stack and import the following:

```js
import * as path from 'path'
import {
	GraphqlApi,
	Schema,
	AuthorizationType,
	FieldLogLevel,
	MappingTemplate,
	PrimaryKey,
	Values,
} from '@aws-cdk/aws-appsync-alpha'
```
From here, let's create our API by pasting in the following:

```js
const api = new GraphqlApi(this, 'TodoTestAPI', {
  name: 'TodoTestAPI',
  schema: Schema.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql')),
  authorizationConfig: {
    defaultAuthorization: {
      authorizationType: AuthorizationType.USER_POOL,
      userPoolConfig: {
        userPool,
      },
    },
    additionalAuthorizationModes: [
      {
        authorizationType: AuthorizationType.API_KEY,
        apiKeyConfig: {
          name: 'simple api key',
          description: 'a simple api key',
          expires: Expiration.after(Duration.days(30)),
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  logConfig: {
    fieldLogLevel: FieldLogLevel.ALL,
  },
  xrayEnabled: true,
})
```
Breaking things down a bit, after initializing our API, we give it a name and tell it where to find our schema. The `path` module is handy to make sure it always find the file even after the project builds.

Next, we tell AppSync that our default auth mode is our UserPool. This will become more apparent when we work with our frontend. Additionally we create an API key and expire it after 30 days.

The last parts of our API are to help in observability. We're logging the requests and responses to CloudWatch as they are made, and turning on [AWS Xray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) so that we can observe any latency of our API.

# Attaching datasources to our AppSync API

We have our UserPool, we have our API and Todo table. Now it's time to bring it all together. 

> üìù This is also where the newer AppSync package we installed shines.

The `MappingTemplate` property has several methods on it that greatly simplify interacting with data sources, and in our case, completely remove the need to write VTL.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658765359919/sHk6VoqJ3.png align="left")

Let's see this in action by pasting in the following snippet:

```js
api
.addDynamoDbDataSource('TodoTableQueryGetTodo', todoTable)
.createResolver({
  typeName: 'Query',
  fieldName: 'getTodo',
  requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbGetItem('id', 'id'),
  responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbResultItem(),
})

api
.addDynamoDbDataSource('TodoTableQueryScanTodos', todoTable)
.createResolver({
  typeName: 'Query',
  fieldName: 'listTodos',
  requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbScanTable(),
  responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbResultList(),
})
```

Above, we assign our `todoTable` as a datasource and use the `createResolver` method to  map our GraphQL request to our DynamoDB table. Specifically, in the first section we _query_ the table, while in the second section we _scan_ the table.

Worth calling out is the `MappingTemplate.dynamoDbGetItem('id', 'id')` part. As maybe expected, the first parameter says "What is the primary key of this table?". The second part says, "Where on this incoming AppSync request can I find it?"

Be default, the second argument will look at the `$context.arguments` property of our request since it contains all the information about what variables got passed. Since our `id` a top-level variable (we're not nesting it), we pass `id`. This will now use the `$context.arguments.id` field.

Add in the remaining resolvers to complete our API:

```js
api
  .addDynamoDbDataSource('TodoTableMutationAddTodo', todoTable)
  .createResolver({
    typeName: 'Mutation',
    fieldName: 'addTodo',
    requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbPutItem(
      PrimaryKey.partition('id').auto(),
      Values.projecting('input')
    ),
    responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbResultItem(),
  })

api
  .addDynamoDbDataSource('TodoTableMutationUpdateTodo', todoTable)
  .createResolver({
    typeName: 'Mutation',
    fieldName: 'updateTodo',
    requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbPutItem(
      PrimaryKey.partition('id').is('input.id'),
      Values.projecting('input')
    ),
    responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbResultItem(),
  })

api
  .addDynamoDbDataSource('TodoTableMutationDeleteTodo', todoTable)
  .createResolver({
    typeName: 'Mutation',
    fieldName: 'deleteTodo',
    requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbDeleteItem('id', 'id'),
    responseMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbResultItem(),
  })
```
Where the first set of resolvers represented the `Query`s of our API, these represent the `Mutation`s.

Two parts worth calling out:

*On the `addTodo` mutation*
```js
requestMappingTemplate: MappingTemplate.dynamoDbPutItem(
  PrimaryKey.partition('id').auto(),
  Values.projecting('input')
),
```
- The `id` of our `Todo` being created is automatically generated.
- `Values.projecting('input')` takes in the **path** of where we would like to accept our arguments, starting with the `$context.arguments` field. Recall our `addTodo` mutation has the signature `addTodo(**input**: TodoInput): Todo`.

*On the `updateTodo` mutation*
```js
PrimaryKey.partition('id').is('input.id'),
```
- The primary key of our table is `id`. We traverse the incoming request by going to our `input` and then the `id` field on it.

üéâ That's it! We now have a complete AppSync API with API Key and Cognito authorization.

# Exporting values to a file

We have our API, but our frontend needs to make use of them. Let's export them to a file.

To export variables we use the `CfnOutput` function. Add in the following:

```js
new CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolId', {
  value: userPool.userPoolId,
})

new CfnOutput(this, 'UserPoolClientId', {
  value: userPoolClient.userPoolClientId,
})

new CfnOutput(this, 'GraphQLAPIURL', {
  value: api.graphqlUrl,
})
new CfnOutput(this, 'GraphQLAPIKey', {
  value: api.apiKey as string,
})

new CfnOutput(this, 'GraphQLAPIID', {
  value: api.apiId,
})
```

Those are all of the values that our frontend needs.

When we deploy the project, those values will be printed to our terminal. However, we can go one step further and persist them to a local file.

Run the following command to deploy our app and generate a `cdk-outputs` file:

```bash
npx aws-cdk deploy --outputs-file ./cdk-outputs.json
```
# Interacting with a NextJS frontend

Having a deployed backend to the cloud is great, but let's take it a step further by calling our API from a frontend.

Outside of our current directory, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app todo-frontend 
```
This will scaffold out a new NextJS application. Once done being created, open it up in your  code editor. 

To integrate with the backend we created, we'll need to install a few packages:

```bash
npm i @aws-amplify/ui-react aws-amplify
```
The first package is the [Amplify UI library](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/). This provides several react primitives as well as a full authentication flow. The second package is the Amplify JavaScript library. This allows us to interact with our backend.

Now that those packages are installed, open up the `_app.js` file and replace it with the following:

```js
import '../styles/globals.css'
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css'
import { AmplifyProvider } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify'
import config from '../src/aws-exports'

Amplify.configure(config)

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
		<AmplifyProvider>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</AmplifyProvider>
	)
}

export default MyApp
```
By wrapping our application in an `AmplifyProvider` we allow the styles and user session to persist throughout our application.

Note that this file is expecting a `config` file coming from a `src` directory. Instead of manually adding in our API details, let's have Amplify create it for us.

In your terminal run the following command:

```bash
amplify init
```

> üö® If you don't already have the amplify CLI installed globally, run the following command: `npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli`

After following the prompts to setup your application, run this command in your terminal to bring in your config:

```bash
amplify add codegen --apiId YOUR_API_ID
```

Recall that we put our API ID in our exports file. Be sure to replace `YOUR_API_ID` with that value.

Upon running this command, not only will the `aws-exports` file be populated with our API credentials, but all of our queries, mutations, and subscriptions have been automatically generated for us as well!

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1658768670502/RQ51c2HmV.png align="left")

Anytime the backend schema changes, simply run `amplify codegen` to populate those changes!

The last part we need to add is our Cognito service so that users can log in/out. Fortunately, we logged all of the variables we need in our backend.

Add in the relevant variables so that the final out of the `aws-exports` file looks similar to the following:

```js
// note that Auth is top-level, whereas the API stuff is not
const awsmobile = {
	Auth: {
		region: 'us-east-1',
		userPoolId: 'us-east-1_YOUR_REGION_ID',
		userPoolWebClientId: '6vstsuciYOURCLIENTID',
	},
	aws_project_region: 'us-east-1',
	aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint:
		'https://your-api.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql',
	aws_appsync_region: 'us-east-1',
	aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS',
	aws_appsync_apiKey: 'da2-YOUR-API-KEY',
}

export default awsmobile
```
üéâ  That's it! To test out the auth flow, head to `pages/index.js` and [wrap the default export in a `withAuthenticator` component](https://github.com/Focus-Otter/appsync-simple-auth-frontend/blob/main/pages/index.js#L96)

# Conclusion

This project was a lot of fun to put together and really showcases how Amplify doesn't have to be used holistically, but rather in pieces that best fit your use case. Leveraging the CDK to build your backend is not only an excellent choice for many apps, but allows teams to become modular and form their own opinions on certain aspects of their project.

Code for this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Focus-Otter/appsync-simple-auth-backend). And likewise, if wanting to see the API calls needed to verify the Todo API, checkout the relevant code [here](https://github.com/Focus-Otter/appsync-simple-auth-frontend/blob/main/pages/index.js#L96).

Note that this solution doesn't use VTL, and for some apps, that's fine. But most apps will want fine-grained authorization, pagination, filtering and default field assignment.

In those use cases, a little VTL can go a long way, and we'll explore those topics in a followup post!
