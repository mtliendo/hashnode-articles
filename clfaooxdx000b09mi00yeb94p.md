As a frontend developer, you're probably used to working with modern web frameworks like React or Vue, which allow you to build complex applications using familiar programming languages. [The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) is similar in that it lets you define your infrastructure using code, but for the cloud instead of the web.

With the CDK, you can use TypeScript to define your cloud infrastructure, including services like Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. By defining your infrastructure in one place, it can be versioned and easily reproduced. This is a huge benefit over clicking through the AWS console.

AWS has a service that already does this: CloudFormation. But it's known for being verbose. The CDK is a wrapper around CloudFormation that also comes with a set of libraries to make it easy to define best practices and security policies for your cloud resources. This means that you can ensure that your infrastructure is secure and follows AWS best practices without having to spend too much time learning about the specifics upfront.

In this post, we'll walk through how to get started with the CDK, starting with creating an AWS user and installing the AWS CLI. In later posts, we'll also deploy services and bring them into our frontend applications.

## **Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or later is installed.
    
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed.
    
* [An AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

## **Steps**

### **\[optional\] Creating a New AWS User with Admin Role**

First you need to create a new AWS user with the appropriate permissions. Follow these steps to create a new user with the **Administrator** role and generate an access key and secret access key:

1. Sign in to the [**AWS Management Console**](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
    
2. Navigate to the [**IAM (Identity and Access Management) service**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    
3. In the navigation pane, click on **Users** and then click the **Add users** button.
    
4. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1678943576127/f691a6d9-582e-4d42-99fe-bd8f3edc8f43.png align="center")
    
5. Enter a **User name** and select the **Programmatic access** checkbox in the "Select AWS access type" section (adding console access is optional but preferred). Click **Next: Permissions**.
    
6. You can choose to add the user to an existing group, copy permissions from an existing user, or attach policies directly. For this guide, we will add the user to an existing group. Click the **Add user to group** tab.
    
7. Click the **Create group** button to create a new group with the Administrator role. Enter a name for the group, such as "Admins".
    
8. In the search bar, type `AdministratorAccess` and select the checkbox next to the `AdministratorAccess` policy. Click **Create group**.
    
9. You should now see the newly created "Admins" group. Select the checkbox next to the group and click **Next: Tags**.
    
10. (Optional) Add any tags you want to associate with the user, then click **Next: Review**.
    
11. Review the user details and permissions, then click **Create user**.
    
12. After the user is created, you will see the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** for the new user. **Important:** This is the only time you will be able to view the secret access key, so be sure to download the .csv file or copy the keys to a safe location.
    

Now that you have created a new AWS user with the Administrator role and obtained the access key and secret access key, you can proceed to configure the AWS CLI using the `aws configure` command. Enter the access key and secret access key when prompted.

1. **Install AWS CLI**
    

Follow the installation instructions from the [**official AWS documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

1. **Configure a default AWS profile**
    

To configure your AWS CLI, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
aws configure
```

You will be prompted to enter your `AWS Access Key ID`, `AWS Secret Access Key`, `Default region name`, and `Default output format`. Fill in the details and press Enter.

1. **Install AWS CDK using npx**
    

Instead of installing the AWS CDK globally, we will use `npx` to run the latest version:

```bash
npx aws-cdk@latest
```

1. **Bootstrap your environment**
    

Run the following command to bootstrap your environment. This is a one-time-per-region process and essentially authorizes the CDK to deploy resources on your behalf:

```bash
npx aws-cdk bootstrap
```

1. **Initialize a new CDK project with TypeScript**
    

Create a new directory for your CDK project and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir my-cdk-project
cd my-cdk-project
```

*Note: Initializing a new CDK project should be done in an empty directory.*

Now, initialize the new CDK project with TypeScript:

```bash
npx aws-cdk init --language typescript
```

## **Running CDK commands**

Whenever you need to run CDK commands, use `npx aws-cdk`:

```bash
npx aws-cdk <command>
```

For example, to list your CDK stacks:

```bash
npx aws-cdk list
```

To synthesize your CDK app:

```bash
npx aws-cdk synth
```

Now you have successfully installed AWS CDK version 2 with NPM, configured the AWS CLI, and initialized a new CDK project with TypeScript.

If wanting to destroy your CDK app:

```bash
npx aws-cdk destroy
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully installed AWS CDK version 2 with NPM and configured it for use with the AWS CLI.

In the next post, we'll create our first AWS services
