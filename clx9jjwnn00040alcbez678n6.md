Don't get me wrong: I love how simple Amazon Cognito makes it to get email authentication working. It even has direct support for Google and Facebook. But what about authenticating with Notion, GitHub, Slack, etc? That's when I reach for [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). Clerk is more than just a auth provider. It's an entire user management platform that makes it really simple to get authentication setup.

However, adding a third-party SaaS when the rest of your application backend is built on AWS can seem tricky. That's why in this post, I'm going to show *exactly* how to put the two together.

## Application Overview

%[https://github.com/focusOtter/fullstack-with-clerk-auth] 

> üóíÔ∏è All the code relating to this post can be found in the repo above.

Typically, when I add authorization with AWS, it's with Amazon Cognito. In Amplify Gen 2, this is done for you since when you scaffold your application with `npm create amplify`, both a `data` and `auth` resource are created. However, the underlying API ([AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)) has a trick up its sleeve: You can create a Lambda function to have complete control over how the authentication works. This Lambda function can then be set as the authentication mechanism on the API instead of a Cognito userpool.

```typescript
export const data = defineData({
	name: 'fullstack-with-clerk',
	schema,
	authorizationModes: {
		defaultAuthorizationMode: 'lambda', // set the mode
		lambdaAuthorizationMode: {
			function: APIAuthorizer, // apply the lambda function
		},
	},
})
```

## Understanding AWS AppSync Lambda Authorizers

Lambda authorizers in AWS AppSync work differently than those found in other API services on AWS. In my opinion, they're much simpler.

In short, as long as you return an object with an `isAuthorized` boolean, you're all set. How you form the `true` or `false` value for that boolean is up to you.

Any authorization tokens passed to our API will appear on the `event.authorizationToken` parameter. In our application, we'll use the JWT of the user from Clerk, verify it, and then decode it to get the users `sub`. If all of that works, then we know they are authorized:

```typescript
import { Handler } from 'aws-lambda'
import jwt, { JwtPayload } from 'jsonwebtoken'
import * as crypto from 'crypto'
import { env } from '$amplify/env/clerk-api-authorizer'

const jwkToPem = (jwk: string) => {
	const keyObject = crypto.createPublicKey({
		key: jwk,
		format: 'jwk',
	})

	const pem = keyObject.export({
		type: 'spki',
		format: 'pem',
	})

	return pem
}
//make sure lambda runtime supports `fetch` (v >= 20)
export const handler: Handler = async (event: {
	authorizationToken: string
}) => {
	const token = event.authorizationToken
	const secret = env.CLERK_API_KEY
	const validDomains = ['http://localhost:5173']

	const res = await fetch('https://api.clerk.com/v1/jwks', {
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${secret}`,
		},
	})

	const data = await res.json()
	const pem = jwkToPem(data.keys[0])

	let decoded: JwtPayload | null = null
	try {
		decoded = jwt.verify(token, pem) as JwtPayload
	} catch (e) {
		console.log('the error', e)
		return 'Invalid token'
	}

	if (!decoded || !validDomains.includes(decoded.azp))
		return { isAuthorized: false }

	return {
		isAuthorized: decoded.sub ? true : false,
		resolverContext: { owner: decoded.sub },
	}
} 
```

A couple of notes on the code above:

1. The `env` object from Amplify is Gen 2 specific. More details can be found [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars/#local-environment). If not using Gen 2 (AWS CDK), you'll have to get the Clerk secret from SSM or another mechanism.
    
2. The endpoint `'https://api.clerk.com/v1/jwks'` was figured out by following the Clerk docs for [manually verifying the JWT](https://clerk.com/docs/backend-requests/handling/manual-jwt). The rest is just getting the returned keys, generating a pem file, and verifying the token with the pem.
    
3. In the return statement, I'm passing `resolverContext`. Think of this as metadata that by API resolvers can then make use of. It will be available as `context.identity.resolverContext.owner`. If you just want authenticated users to access your API, then this is not needed, but this is important is you want to scope data to a particular user.
    

> The repo is a fullstack example with `react-router-dom`. If you want to learn how to create a fullstack app with Clerk and `react-router-dom`, checkout the getting started page from [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/add-react-router).

## API Endpoints with Clerk and AWS AppSync

If your goal is to have Clerk provide the authentication for an app where everyone signs in and shares data, then the rest is pretty straightforward:

In your Amplify Gen 2 schema, you can have Amplify create your resources as normal:

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
	Milestone: a
		.model({
			title: a.string().required(),
			description: a.string(),
		})
		.authorization((allow) => [allow.publicApiKey(), allow.custom('function')])
})
```

That will create the resolvers for you to be able to to create, read, update, and delete.

However, typically, you'll want to scope those operations so that only the logged in user can manipulate the data, without affecting everyone else. This is called *owner-based authorization*, and what I'll show.

> üóíÔ∏è The following JS resolvers work both with Amplify Gen 2 and the AWS CDK

### Creating an item with owner

Imagine we already have a datasource: a DynamoDB table setup. Also, recall that our Lambda function used for authorization is passing the `owner` on the `resolverContext`.

```typescript
import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils'
import * as ddb from '@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb'

// This is the request to our database
export function request(ctx) {
	const { owner } = ctx.identity.resolverContext
	const id = util.autoId()
	const now = util.time.nowISO8601()
	const item = {
		...ctx.args,
		id,
		owner,
		createdAt: now,
		updatedAt: now,
	}
	const key = { id }
	return ddb.put({ key, item })
}

// This is the response from our database
export function response(ctx) {
	return ctx.result
}
```

Because AWS AppSync has first-class support for DynamoDB, we can make use of the AppSync `util` package, as well as the DynamoDB helpers package.

We combine those two to create things like a random `id`, set the time using `now.ISO8601`, and `put` the item in the table with its `owner` field.

The `result` is simply the item as it was stored in DynamoDB.

In short, any signed in user can create.

### Getting an item by owner

When it comes to getting an item from DynamoDB, we effectively say, "Any signed in use can get an item from the database, but for the database to respond back to the client with the information, the `owner` field on the item has to match the `owner` field from the Lambda authorizer:

```typescript
import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils'
import * as ddb from '@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb'

export function request(ctx) {
	// get a todo by its id (API protects this so only auth users can call it)
	return ddb.get({ key: { id: ctx.args.id } })
}

export function response(ctx) {
	//if the owner field isn't the same as the identity, the throw
	const { owner: clerkUser } = ctx.identity.resolverContext
	const { owner: ddbOwner } = ctx.result
	if (ddbOwner !== clerkUser) {
		util.unauthorized()
	}

	return ctx.result
}
```

So long as that is the case, then return the data.

### Updating an item if owner

Updating is fun because now we get to use DynamoDB conditions to do a lot of the work for us:

```typescript
import { util } from '@aws-appsync/utils'
import * as ddb from '@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb'

export function request(ctx) {
	const { id, title, description } = ctx.args
	const { owner } = ctx.identity.resolverContext
	const now = util.time.nowISO8601()

	const updateObj = {
		title: ddb.operations.replace(title),
		description: ddb.operations.replace(description),
		updatedAt: ddb.operations.replace(now),
	}

	// update it if owner.
	return ddb.update({
		key: { id },
		update: updateObj,
		condition: { owner: { eq: owner } },
	})
}

export function response(ctx) {
	return ctx.result
}
```

Think of a form in a web app, were it populates all of the data about the item in various `input` boxes. The user can then update them and click *submit*. The backend get all of the information and simply updates the item in the database. What I love about updating is it shows the `replace` utility as well as the `time.nowISO8601` utility for updating the timestamp.

### Deleting an item if owner

Deleting is similar to getting an item, except we get to rely on DynamoDB conditions to make sure it's only deleted is the `owner` fields match:

```typescript
import * as ddb from '@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb'

export function request(ctx) {
	// delete a todo by its id if it's the owner
	const { owner } = ctx.identity.resolverContext
	return ddb.remove({
		key: { id: ctx.args.id },
		condition: { owner: { eq: owner } },
	})
}

export function response(ctx) {
	return ctx.result
}
```

### Pagination (listing items if owner)

I saved this one for last because it's its own way of doing things. In a na√Øve implementation, we may be tempted to just return an array of items. In fact, if we were `scan`ning the table, that's what we'd get back. But in a real-world scenario, we want to efficiently query the data in our table and return a placeholder (`token`) if there are more items than our `limit` is set for:

```typescript
import * as ddb from '@aws-appsync/utils/dynamodb'

export function request(ctx) {
	const { owner } = ctx.identity.resolverContext
	return ddb.query({
		query: { owner: { eq: owner } },
		index: 'milestonesByOwner',
		limit: ctx.args.limit || 25,
		nextToken: ctx.args.nextToken,
	})
}

export function response(ctx) {
	const { items = [], nextToken } = ctx.result

	return { items, nextToken }
}
```

There's nothing inherently *hard* about this example, but it takes consideration. `limit` and `nextToken` aside, the `index` is what matters most here.

By default, our database is set with a `primaryKey` of `id`. However, for listing content, we want only search through items by their `owner` field. In short, we want a `globalSecondaryIndex`.

If not using Amplify and just using vanilla CDK, this can be achieved fairly easily as shown in my CDK starter repo. And if using Amplify Gen 2, this can be achieved as shown in the `amplify/data/resource.ts` file.
