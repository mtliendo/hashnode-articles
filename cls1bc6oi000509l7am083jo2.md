When [AWS announced for AppSync as an EventBrige target](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/01/amazon-eventbridge-appsync-target-buses/), I thought of the use cases this unlocks. For those that aren't aware, it was already possible for [AppSync to put an event directly on an event bus](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/aws-appsync-publishing-events-amazon-eventbridge/). So I figured there was some lambda-less solution that would no be unlocked!

## Configuring AppSync to pass data to EventBridge

In hindsight, I may have downplayed the power of EventBridge and AppSync by using `localhost:3000` in my demo. In truth, real-time subscriptions can scale beyond 3M events per second.

However the principle is the same: Application 1 is a normal app, doing normal things. Then one day Application 2 decides they want to display that data in real-time. No polling, no sharing of resources, just taking an event and passing along the data associated with it.

It's possible for Application 1 to simple invoke an API endpoint provided by Application 2. But they are coupled. Any changes on either side and there needs to be communication. In an event-driven world, this becomes a non-issue. Application 1 would simply put a message on an event bus. It doesn't know or care what downstream services pick it up.

This scenario is exactly what the first repository does.

As mentioned earlier, AWS AppSync has direct support for Amazon EventBridge as a datasource. That means all the [SigV2 signing](https://blog.focusotter.com/how-to-invoke-appsync-from-a-lambda-function#heading-how-to-allow-lambda-to-sign-with-sigv4) it handled for you with one line of code:

```typescript
const eventBridgeDS = api.addEventBridgeDataSource('gameBusDS', bus)
```

Now this simply forms the connection, however the function that passes the data is also fairly trivial:

```typescript
export function request(ctx: Context): PutEventsRequest {
	// The data that gets sent to EventBridge
	return {
		operation: 'PutEvents',
		events: [
			{
				source: ctx.stash.eventBridgeSource,
				detailType: ctx.stash.eventBridgeDetailType,
				detail: { ...ctx.prev.result },
			},
		],
	}
}

export function response(ctx: Context) {
	//Return the data from EventBridge back to AppSync
	return ctx.prev.result
}
```

## Understanding EventBridge rules and targets

Passing an event to an event bus does effectively nothing. Consumers (targets) subscribe to *rules* on that event bus. The rule looks at the incoming event payload and says, "based on *this* matching criteria, I will invoke these targets".

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706664243389/33420be3-30b8-4750-9e9a-9fa28c850ad6.png align="center")

From the diagram, we can see that an EventBridge bus has a rule setup that will call an AppSync API.

In the second repo, the code that configures this is as follows:

```typescript
const mybroadcastRule = new events.CfnRule(scope, 'cfnRule', {
	eventBusName: bus.eventBusName,
	name: 'broadcastToAppSyncRule',
	eventPattern: {
		source: ['game.broadcast'],
		['detail-type']: ['GameUpdated'],
	},
	targets: [
       //The targets that care about this message
    ]
})
```

Note the `eventPattern` object. This rule will invoke the `targets` if the incoming event payload has `game.broadcast` as the `source` and `GameUpdated` as the `detail-type`.

The next part of this repo is likely where--if you're like me, you'll make the most small-and-hard-to-detect errors:

Adding the target.

This is because we're using the L1 construct, so there aren't any utilities for better mapping EventBridge data to an AppSync operation. You get intellisense, but as someone who is used to working with L2 constructs primarily, feeling something to be desired.

```typescript
targets: [
	{
		id: 'appsyncBroadcastReceiver',
		arn: props.appsyncEndpointArn,
		roleArn: ebRuleRole.roleArn,
		appSyncParameters: {
			graphQlOperation: props.graphQlOperation,
		},
		inputTransformer: {
			inputPathsMap: {
				createdAt: '$.detail.createdAt',
				updatedAt: '$.detail.updatedAt',
				name: '$.detail.name',
				homeTeamScore: '$.detail.homeTeamScore',
				awayTeamScore: '$.detail.awayTeamScore',
				currentMessage: '$.detail.currentMessage',
				id: '$.detail.id',
			},
			inputTemplate: JSON.stringify({
				input: {
					createdAt: '<createdAt>',
					updatedAt: '<updatedAt>',
					name: '<name>',
					homeTeamScore: '<homeTeamScore>',
					awayTeamScore: '<awayTeamScore>',
					currentMessage: '<currentMessage>',
					id: '<id>',
				},
			}),
		},
	},
],
```

The first 3 lines should make sense. The 4th line is where we pass in the AppSync operation we're working with.

> üóíÔ∏è Running `npx @aws-amplify/cli codegen add` in a directory that contains the `schema.graphql` file will generate the needed types for you.

However, the focus is on the `inputPathsMap` and the `inputTemplate.`

### Understanding the EventBridge InputPathsMap

As someone who doesn't often work with EventBridge, I'll do my best here.

Essentially, a EventBridge payload is an object of whatever depth. I imagine some are deeply nested. Furthermore, EventBridge doesn't care about what data a target needs. As such, the `inputPathsMap` is your chance to flatten the data and pull out just the values you need.

Similar to how a Lambda function has `event` or AppSync has `context`, EventBridge rules put the data under `"$"`. So the event source is `"$.source"` while all the arguments that we passed in are under `"$.detail"`.

### Understanding the EventBridge InputTemplate

The `inputTemplate` works in conjunction with the `inputPathsMap`. If the latter lets us pull out the values we need, then the former allows us to structure it however we like.

Again, an EventBridge rule has no idea how we need our data structured, so it's up to us to tell it.

> üóíÔ∏è This isn't *entirely* true. In my testing, when I put in the wrong structure for my AppSync input and tried to deploy, my deploy would fail while performing some validation on my behalf.

It's worth noting that the `inputTemplate` is a string. It's also good to see that the `input` object is only there because our AppSync schema has an `input` field for the `publishMsgFromEB` Mutation.

## Conclusion

These two separate apps form the basis of connecting real-time applications together without them being inherently coupled. Event-driven architectures is a big topic, and I hope this helped you understand just how powerful-yet-approachable it can be when using the AWS CDK to provision your services.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this! Let me know in the comments.

Until next time,

Happy Coding ü¶¶
